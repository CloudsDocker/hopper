# How can i build this?
  1) make sure you have a GHC installed and in your path whose reported `ghc --version` matches
one of the configurations listed in the tested-with field of the `hopper.cabal` file.
  2) have an up to date version of cabal-install installed.

## Can I use stack to build this?
No, we do not provide user facing support for using the stack build facilities,
we only have that as a convenience for the members of the development team who
are using stack for their personal development environment. If you really want
help with stack, ask Brian really nicely
